In a practical implementation, the variables used to represent the indices will often be of fixed size,
 and this can result in an arithmetic overflow for very large arrays. 
 If the midpoint of the span is calculated as
 (l+r)/2
 then the value of l+r may exceed the range of integers of the data type used to store the midpoint,
  even if l and r are within the range. If l and r are nonnegative, this can be avoided by
   calculating the midpoint as
   l+(l+r)/2
