There are two approaches for this problem

Approach 1
we store the trusted person value with the number of persons trust him in a map.
and check whether its value is N-1 or not, if yes then we check if this person trust
other person or not if not then its the answer if yes then we return -1;


Approach 2
we kept a count array, If a person is trusted by other person then we increment its frequency and if a person trust
other person then we decrement its frequency, then final we check if any number exist in count array whose frequency
is N-1 if yes then this is the answer, if not then we return -1;
