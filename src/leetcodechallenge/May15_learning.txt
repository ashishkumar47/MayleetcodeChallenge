This problem is similar to Kadane's algorithm where we find the maximum subarray sum in fixed array.
There are are two cases that we have to handle in this problem.
case 1: maximum sum is present in regular array.

case 2:maximum sum is present in split way(half sum is present in normal array and half sum is present in next
circular array)

case 1 can be found using Kadane's algorithm.
for case 2 we have to calculate sum of total array and minimum sub array sum. and output will be sum-minimum subarry
sum.

final result will be max(maximum Subarray,totalSum-minimum Subarray).

last we have to handle is when all elements are negative in this case, totalSum==minimum Sub array,this will
lead the false result.In that case we have to return maximum element of the array.
