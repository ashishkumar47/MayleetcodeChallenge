we can use xor operator for reversing the bit of a number
->If we do a xor between a bit and 1 the it will reverse the bit.
->If we do a xor between a bit and 0 then it will give the bit as a result without any change in it.

                 X | Y | z
                 1 | 1 | 0
                 1 | 0 | 1
                 0 | 1 | 1
                 0 | 0 | 0
