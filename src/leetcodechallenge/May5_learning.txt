Instead of using hashMap for storing values we can use frequency array for storing the values,
but for that we have to know the highest number possible in that array, so that we can make frequency array of
that size and we don't get the ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception.

"s.charAt(i)-97"  This expression will give the corresponding position of the alphabet in lexographically order.
