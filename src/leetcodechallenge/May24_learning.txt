The idea behind the approach is that

we take help of preorder that first index of array is root,and apply the bst property that left part of root is
always smaller than root and right part is always greater than root.
so we search the index till the element which is greater than root this will determine the end of left subtree
and start of right subtree, and we divide the array in two parts on the basis of this.
and we proceed the same approach with the left half of array and right half of array recursively.
and one thing we keep in mind in every recursive call is that the first element of array is the root.
