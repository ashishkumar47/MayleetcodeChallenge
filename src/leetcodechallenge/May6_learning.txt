There are 4 different approaches for this problem

1. BruteForce approach
timeComplexity: O(N^2)
spaceComplexity: O(1)

2. using HashMap
timeComplexity: O(N)
spaceComplexity: O(N)

3. using Sorting
timeComplexity: O(NlogN)
spaceComplexity: O(1);

4. using Boyer-Moore voting Algorithm
timeComplexity: O(N)
Boyer-Moore performs constant work exactly nn times, so the algorithm runs in linear time
spaceComplexity: O(1)
Boyer-Moore allocates only constant additional memory
