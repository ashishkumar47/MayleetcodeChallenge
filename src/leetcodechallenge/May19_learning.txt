This problem is similar to the stock span problem solved using stack.
It's an online algorithm, we can't see the future elements,we need to give the answer by seeing the current
element.
The idea behind the algorithm is when ever we get a new price, we find the last greatest element from the current
 element and we count the number of days between this position and the price and add to that to span and return
 span.
 for save the extra calls we maintain a variable "lastDayStock" which will store the previous day price.
 if the price is smaller than the "lastDayStock" or list size is 1 then we directly return 1.
