The idea to solve the problem is 

Approach 1
this problem can be solved using recursion, but this will give the TLE for larger strings.
If the character of the word matches then we decrement both the lengths.
if it not matched then we have three choices.
1. insert-> s1,s2.substring(1);
2. delete-> s1.substring(1),s2;
3. replace->s1.substring(1),s2.substring(1);
Then return the min of them.

Approach 2
Approach2 is the optimisation of the recursive method, we save the already solved subproblem in a DP array
,instead of calculating it again we directly return the previously saved result.
