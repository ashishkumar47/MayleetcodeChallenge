Three points are collinear points if exactly one line passes through it.

There are three methods to find wether the 3 points are collinear or not.

Let A,B,C are 3 points then the 3 points will be collinear if

(1) The slope of line segment joining point A , B equals to the slope of line segment joining point B,C.

(2) Area bounded by the triangle joining points A,B,C is zero.

(3) The sum of distance between AB and BC is equal to the distance AC.

We will considered first two points as A and B and rest of them as a C in loop.
