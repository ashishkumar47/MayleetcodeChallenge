The approach for the problem is to finding the parent nodes and and there respective levels for the given 
two nodes.
After finding these values we just compare the level of parent nodes and there respective values.
if they are at same level and different values then we return true else false;

Approach 1

In this approach we use two arrays of size 2 to store the values of level and parent value,then we
compare these values for two given nodes to get the final result;

Approach 2

In this Approach we have make a separate class for storing the values of parent and the level and we return the
the object of this class, we get two objects for two given node and we compare them to get the final result.
