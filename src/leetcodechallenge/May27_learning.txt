The idea behind solving this problem is using BFS using adjacency list

we first create the adjacency list from the given array.
In adjacency list every element will contain its dislike elements which will not be lie in the same group.
we start DFS from the first element of adjacency list and start assigning groups to the element and its
corresponding dislike elements.
The element and its corresponding list elements should be assign to different groups for bipartition.
If the neighbouring point/elements of adjacency list is also assign to the same group of element then we return false;
else return true;
