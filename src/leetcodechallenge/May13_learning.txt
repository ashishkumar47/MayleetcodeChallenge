Its an application of greedy algorithm
we take a stack and maintain a smallest number inside it with k digits removal.
If a digit comes which is smaller than top of the stack then we replace the top of the stack with this digit
and decrement k.and proceed until all the digits are traversed in the string.
If k is still greater than zero it means that there are repeated digits, then we remove these digits until k>0.
Then we form a string from the digits store in stack which is the smallest number.
Then we remove the leading zeros if present and finally return the string.
